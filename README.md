I am a second-year student pursuing my master's in Artificial Intelligence. I have 1-2 years of experience working with `Deep Neural Networks`, `Machine Learning Models`, `Graph Embedding Algorithms`, `Graph Convolutional Networks`, `Reinforcement Learning Models`, `GANs`, and `MLOps`.

I'm an enthusiastic participant in online hackathons and Kaggle competitions, always on the lookout for ways to challenge and enhance my skills. My current research revolves around Automated Game Testing and Validation, where I'm exploring the fascinating possibilities of `Reinforcement Learning (RL)` and `Imitation Learning` techniques.

Lately, I've been diving into the world of `CI/CD` processes. I've been busy learning the ropes of `GitHub Actions`, `KubeFlow`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, and also getting familiarized with Cloud Technologies like `AWS Glue`, `Amazon SageMaker`, `GCloud AutoML`, and `GCloud DataStore`. Looking ahead, I'm excited about my upcoming journey into a **PhD program focusing on MLOps**. My goal is to become an expert in transforming complex data challenges into practical, deployable, and trackable software solutions that have real-world impact.

I am very passionate and resilient about what I enjoy doing.
